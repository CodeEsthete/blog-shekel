The platform enables everyone to launch a masternode without linux or programming knowledge. The mnhost.io platform automatically creates and configures the masternode server for you in the background. At certain points you are asked for input that links your wallet to the masternode server.

Each masternode server you launch costs ~$0.3 per day paid in JEW, which is 50% lower then other platforms.

Open following link to check it out and deploy your first masternode:
